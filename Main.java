/*
Create a Tic Tac Toe board and fill it with dashes.
Create a function that draws the board like a square.
Keep track of the playerâ€™s turn and what symbol they are using.
Keep asking the user to enter a row and col until they are valid.
Set the right position on the board to the proper symbol.
Create a function that checks if either player has won.
Check if the game has ended in a tie.
Use a loop to keep the game going.
